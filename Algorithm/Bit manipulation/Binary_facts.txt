Every even odd numbers binary has end with 1, where every even number binary end with 0.
example: 
          1 -> 001
          2 -> 010
          3 -> 011
          4 -> 100
          5 -> 101
  
 So, we can quickly check a number is odd or not using binary and(&).
 if the result is non-zero then the given number is odd, else the result is 0 then even
