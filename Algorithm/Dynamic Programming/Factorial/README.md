#### As solving Factorial is a non-overloaping problem, so dynamic programming won't help us here, but we can dynamic approach for series of factorial (1! + 2! + 3! + 4!)
#### For regular approach go to -> [Sazin's github](https://github.com/SazinSamin/Samin_Reading_Room/tree/main/Algorithm/miscellaneous/Factorial)
