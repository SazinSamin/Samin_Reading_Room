- A sorting algorithm is said to be stable if the order of equal elements remains the same after sorting.

##### - Bubble sort
        can detect whether the input list is already sorted or not.
        
##### - Selection sort 
        - works well for small files. It is used for sorting the files with very large values and small keys. This is                             - because selection is made based on keys and swaps are made only when required.
        
##### - Insertion Sort 
        practically more efficient than selection and bubble sorts, even though all of them have O(n 2 ) worst case                               complexity.
  
##### - Merge sort 
        used for sorting Linked List.

#### - Counting sort
       there are smaller integers with multiple counts.
       linear complexity is the need.

####   -Practical information.
       Sorting in Dart programming language implemented as when the difference between right & left value is 32 or less, they use regular        insertion sort. But if the difference avobe the level then they use Dual-Pivot Quicksort algorithm.
