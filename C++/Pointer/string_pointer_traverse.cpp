// as this in C or C++, when we pass an array(here is "char" array),
// the array decays to pointer, means instead of copying the whole array & it's element, 
// it just copy the it's first address of the array.
// which is a pointer.
// so, we decode that pointer, and can do pointer arithmetic to traverse than char array here.
// see Denis Riche book for that.
