Depth first search also called Level-Order-Traversal, but the word DSF mainly used for graph as graph may have cycle, so if we visit a  
node once, we don't visit that node again. If we visit that node again, then we can fall on infinite loop in graph.
So, DFS & BFS word mainly used for Graph.
In tree the DFS also we can called as Level-Order-Traversal.
