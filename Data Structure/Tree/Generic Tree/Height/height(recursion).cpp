// To understand how the given array represent the tree, see the README.md file of generic tree folder.
// In this code we get the height of tree by traversing from each node to it's parent node.
// & return the distance from that node to parent node
// Which "node to distant" is most, that will be the height of the tree.



// This function work as,
// suppose the first call of this function from main as array & array[i] = 0
// In 0 position we see 4, means who hold the number 4 position in array is the parent of 0,
// Here we found 1, so 1 is 0's parent, now we again call Height function with 1, 
// In 1 position we found -1, -1 indicate that it is the tree root node.
// Now we stop here by base case and begin to return,
// as we return back from the where we stop, we use programe stack to count the distant from that given node to tree root.
// by adding 1 each time.
