### Generic tree has similary with adjacency list graph data structure(as tree is a special kind of graph).

When we gat array for contruct a tree, the array explain that

Link we have an array -> 
int array[] = {4, -1, 4, 1, 1};

 node 0 is a child of node 4, node 1
 is the root, node 2 is a child of node 4, node 3 is a child of node 1 and node 4 is a child of node 1. To
 see this, let us write numbers of nodes from 0 to 4 in one line and the numbers given in the input in
 the second line underneath:

 0  1 2 3 4
 4 -1 4 1 1

 Now we can see that the node number 1 is the root, because −1 corresponds to it in the second line.
 Also, we know that the nodes number 3 and number 4 are children of the root node 1. Also, we know
 that the nodes number 0 and number 2 are children of the node 4.

                   3     4
                        /  \
                       0     2
