// get the fire element parent div
- event.currentTarget

// https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_target.asp
get the element that triggered the element using

*** the difference of above two method that suppose a div with many childrent
=event.currentTarget only return the "div" click anywhere in that div.
=event.target that exact content was clicked, like if clicked happend in childrent area then that childrent, if div area then div
