// JS is a prototype based language
// prototype helps us to add property directly outside the constructor function
// every object in js has prototype & prototype chain.
// prototype also use for inheritance because if we add a prototype to a object, it will be available to all instance.
// we can also add prototype to js built-in object like String, Number, Boolean (which is highly un-recommended)


function Person(first, last, age) {
        this.firstName = first;
        this.lastName = last;
        this.age = age;
};


// using js "prototype" property allow to add property or method to the
// We can add property directly outside the constructor function

Person.prototype.job = "Software engineer";
Person.prototype.getName = () => this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;

let person1 = new Person("Sazin", "Samin", 24);

// add many prototype at once
Person.prototype = {
        // define constructor also, otherwise check constructor will fail.
        constructor: Person,
        location: "Dhaka",
        getLocation () {
                return this.location;
        }
}


console.log(person1);
// check the instance has created from the Object.
console.log(person1.constructor == Person);
