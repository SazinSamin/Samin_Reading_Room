// var has function scope, if we decleared it any global object like window object for browser
// then it would available to the all functions or statement below it.

console.log(x);


function foo () {
        // declear of same name variable with "var", it has access only inside the function
        // this function also have access to upper "x" variable but as we decleared it again

// block scope.

// console.log(b); // this will leads to error, because it doesn't have access to the "let" variable which is block scope

if(true) {
        const c = 130;
        console.log(c);

// declear variable with "const", we have to assign the value immediately there.
// also we can't reassign the value again.
