//we use scanf to get input from the terminal or stdin.
//Interesting fact about the scanf is that it return 
//how much input you take


//***********   I have got a problem here, if we enter 2 elements, it doesn't stop taking input.


#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
        int a, b, c;
        cout<<scanf("%d %d %d", &a, &b, &c);
}
